# TODO - Data Separation for Student Complaints and Feedback

## Changes to make in script.js:

- [ ] 1. Store userEmail in localStorage after successful login (handleLogin function)
- [ ] 2. Add userEmail field to complaint data when submitting (handleComplaintSubmit function)
- [ ] 3. Filter complaints for student view in updateStatusList function
- [ ] 4. Add userEmail field to feedback data when submitting (handleFeedbackSubmit function)
- [ ] 5. Filter feedback for student view in updateFeedbackList function
- [ ] 6. Ensure admin sees all complaints (no filtering - already works)
